## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

You will need python3, scikit-learn and Flask to run this project. In a debian system you can run the following commands:

```
$ sudo apt install virtualenvwrapper
$ echo "" >> ~/.bashrc
$ source ~/.bashrc   # with this you don't need to exit and enter bash/terminal again.
$ mkdir -p ~/projects/python/
$ cd ~/projects/python
$ git clone git@github.com:ramiroluz/homemon.git
$ cd homemon
$ setvirtualenvproject   # next time you run: workon homemon
$                        # and you will be in this same directory.
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the tests

To run the tests:

```
$ make test
```
